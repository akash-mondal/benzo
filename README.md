# Benzo — private-by-default shielded-USDC payments on Stellar

**Benzo** is a private-by-default, shielded-USDC payments protocol on Stellar
(Soroban), delivered as a private cross-border remittance corridor. Everyday
stablecoin payments hide **both amount and counterparty** through zero-knowledge
shielded notes, while compliance — selective disclosure via hierarchical viewing
keys and Association-Set screening — is built into the regulated fiat edges.

This repository is the **backend / protocol** (no frontend): ZK circuits, a
headless proving SDK, the Soroban contracts, a self-hosted note-discovery
indexer, a gasless relayer, and a self-hosted SEP-24 anchor corridor — all
exercised against **Stellar testnet** with real Circle testnet USDC.

> Built for **Stellar Hacks: Real-World ZK**. ZK is load-bearing by
> construction: strip the proofs and there is no private payment — the pool
> verifies a Groth16 proof on Stellar's native BN254 host functions before it
> will move a cent.

## What's real vs. simulated (read this first)

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Groth16 proving (shield / joinsplit / unshield) | **Real** — headless snarkjs in Node, verified on-chain by the BN254 verifier contract |
| BN254 Groth16 verification | **Real** — Soroban CAP-0074 host functions, on testnet |
| Poseidon2 commitments / nullifiers / Merkle | **Real** — CAP-0075 host function, byte-identical to circuit & SDK (asserted in tests) |
| USDC custody & settlement | **Real** — Circle testnet USDC (issuer `GBBD47IF…FLA5`) as a SAC, custodied by the pool |
| Shield / private transfer / unshield | **Real** — on testnet, with on-chain nullifiers, Merkle commitments, balance moves |
| MVK→TVK viewing-key disclosure | **Real** — HKDF derivation, X25519+AES-GCM, reconstructed from on-chain ciphertext |
| ASP membership / proof-of-innocence | **Real** — enforced in-circuit + on-chain registries |
| Gasless relayer | **Real** — submits proven transfers, paid in USDC out of the pool |
| Note-discovery indexer | **Real** — scans Soroban events, viewing-key scan API (self-hosted, no Mercury key) |
| `@benzo/sdk` facade (`BenzoClient`) | **Real** — the UI-facing API; drives create/shield/send/unshield/disclose end-to-end on testnet |
| send-by-`@handle` | **Real** — on-chain `handle_registry` contract resolves a handle to a shielded address |
| Claim-links | **Real** — note encrypted to a claim secret; a fresh account claims it on-chain |
| Async proving + optimistic UI handle | **Real** — `send()` returns a `SendHandle` (pending→proving→settled); proving is headless Node |
| SEP-1 / SEP-10 / SEP-24 anchor | **Real wire protocol** — self-hosted; **real Ed25519 SEP-10 verification**; real on-chain USDC settlement at both edges |
| **The fiat (bank/cash) ledger leg** | **SIMULATED** — our self-hosted anchor credits "fiat received" / "fiat paid out" with no real bank. This is the only simulated piece, and it is driven explicitly via `POST /sep24/sim/:id`. |

No mainnet keys are used anywhere. `.env` and `reference/` are gitignored.

## Architecture

Three planes (BENZO.md §4): a **client plane** that holds keys and proves
(here: the headless `@benzo/sdk`), an **on-chain plane** of Soroban contracts
that verify proofs and mutate state, and an **off-chain services plane** that
indexes encrypted notes, sponsors fees, and bridges fiat.

### Canonical cryptographic invariants (normative)

- **Commitment** `= Poseidon2(amount, recipient_pk, blinding, asset_id)`
- **Nullifier** `= Poseidon2(spend_sk, leaf_index, NULLIFIER_DOMAIN)`
- **Merkle node** `= Poseidon2(left, right)`; tree `DEPTH = 32`, `ROOT_HISTORY = 128`
- **Proof** Groth16 over BN254, one constant-size multi-pairing check
- **Poseidon2 byte-identical** across circom circuit, the `@benzo/sdk` TS mirror,
  and the Soroban host function — pinned in
  [`circuits/poseidon_params/poseidon2_bn254.json`](circuits/poseidon_params/poseidon2_bn254.json)
  and asserted against the on-chain zero table in tests.
- **Nullifiers in persistent storage only**; idempotent "already spent = success".

## Repository layout

A **pnpm + Turborepo monorepo** — one headless core, many surfaces.

```
packages/
  core/        @benzo/core — headless protocol SDK (notes, Poseidon2, prover iface,
               viewkeys, scanner, contract clients, the BenzoClient facade)

```

## App surfaces

Every surface implements `IBenzoPlatform` and consumes `@benzo/core` + `@benzo/links`;
each app's README lists its concrete TODOs.

| Surface | Status | Prover | Does best | To finish |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CLI** | **built** | Node | scripting + the e2e harness | — |
| Web PWA | scaffold | Wasm | flagship consumer wallet | passkey onboarding + WASM worker prover + UI |
| Telegram | scaffold | Wasm | chat-native `/send @handle` | bot handlers + TWA webview |
| Merchant | scaffold | Node | confidential payroll + auditor view-keys | CSV batch + disclosure console |
| PoS | scaffold | Wasm | private request-QR | QR + settlement polling |
| Paylink | scaffold | Node | claim / request landing pages | landing + one-command deploy |
| Extension | scaffold | Wasm | pay-with-Benzo provider | bg scanner + injected provider |

Build everything: `pnpm -r build`. Test: `cargo test --workspace` (contracts) + `pnpm -r test` (TS).

## How to run

### Prerequisites
- Stellar CLI 25+, Rust + `wasm32v1-none`, Node 20 + pnpm, `circom` 2.2+, `snarkjs`.
- `set -a; . ./.env; set +a` — funded testnet identities `benzo-deployer`,
  `benzo-relayer`, `benzo-anchor-dist`, `benzo-anchor-sign` (already saved).

### Build & test the contracts
```bash
cargo test --workspace          # 85 tests across the 8 contracts + zkhash
stellar contract build          # all 7 contracts -> wasm32v1-none
```

### Build circuits & keys (Groth16)
```bash
# one-time: compile circuits, run a Phase-2 contribution, export VKs
for c in shield joinsplit unshield; do
  circom circuits/groth16/$c.circom --r1cs --wasm -o circuits/build/$c -l circuits/lib
  snarkjs groth16 setup circuits/build/$c/$c.r1cs circuits/ptau/powersOfTau28_hez_final_16.ptau circuits/build/$c/${c}_0.zkey
  echo entropy | snarkjs zkey contribute circuits/build/$c/${c}_0.zkey circuits/build/$c/$c.zkey
  snarkjs zkey export verificationkey circuits/build/$c/$c.zkey circuits/build/$c/${c}_vk.json
done
```

### Build the TypeScript packages
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r build                   # @benzo/sdk, indexer, anchor, relayer
( cd sdk && pnpm test )         # 18 tests incl. circuit proving + Poseidon2 byte-identity
```

### Deploy to testnet
```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
bash scripts/deploy-testnet.sh  # deploys all contracts, wires operators, registers VKs
# one-time: open a USDC trustline for the relayer so it can take USDC fees
#   (see scripts/deploy-testnet.sh notes)
```

### Run the flows against testnet
```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
export ANCHOR_JWT_SECRET=...     # any secret for the self-hosted anchor JWTs
cd tests
node e2e/m1-flow.mjs             # shield → private transfer → unshield (different account)
node e2e/m2-compliance.mjs       # MVK/TVK disclosure + ASP both gates
node e2e/m3-corridor.mjs         # SEP-24 corridor: fiat-sim → … → fiat-sim
pnpm exec vitest run e2e/e2e.test.mjs   # green suite driving items 1–5
```

## UI-facing SDK API — the exact contract a frontend calls

A frontend uses ONLY `BenzoClient` from `@benzo/sdk`. It wraps the pool client,
the note scanner/indexer, the headless prover, and the viewing-key crypto
behind stable typed methods. `send()` is non-blocking so a UI can render
optimistic state over the proving pipeline.

```ts
import { BenzoClient, StellarCli, configFromEnv, stroopsToUsdc } from "@benzo/sdk";

const client = new BenzoClient({
  cli: new StellarCli(configFromEnv()),
  deployment,        // contract ids (deployments/testnet.json)
  circuits,          // {shield, joinsplit, unshield} wasm + zkey paths
  rpcUrl, txSource,  // Soroban RPC + the gas-paying CLI identity
  relayer, anchor, handleRegistry,   // all optional
});

// — account —
client.createOrLoadAccount(path, { label?, stellarSecret? }) // -> { account, created }
client.createAccount(label?, stellarSecret?)                 // -> BenzoAccount
client.address()                                             // -> BenzoRecipient (shareable, no spend authority)

// — balance & history —
await client.sync()                 // rebuild scanner + Merkle/ASP mirrors from chain
await client.getBalance()           // -> bigint   (aggregated spendable, stroops)
client.getHistory()                 // -> HistoryItem[]  {type, amount, counterparty?, timestamp, status, txHash?}

// — value movement —
await client.shield({ amount, fromAddress, fromSource })     // public USDC -> shielded note
const h = client.send({ amount, to, memo?, useRelayer? })    // -> SendHandle (async)
h.onProgress(e => …)                // 'pending' -> 'proving' -> 'settled'
await h.settled()                   // resolves { txHash, amount, recipient?, provingMs }
await client.unshield({ amount, toAddress })                 // shielded -> public USDC

// — UX primitives —
await client.registerHandle({ handle, ownerAddress, ownerSource })   // @handle -> address (on-chain)
await client.resolveHandle("@bob")                                   // -> BenzoRecipient
await client.sendToHandle({ handle, amount, memo? })                 // resolve + send
const { link } = await client.createClaimLink({ amount })           // send-to-link
const secret = BenzoClient.parseClaimLink(link)
await client.claim({ claimSecret: secret, toAddress })              // fresh account claims

// — compliance —
const { tvk, reconstruct } = client.shareReceipt(scope?)    // scoped disclosure (auditor)

// — fiat edges (anchor; fiat leg SIMULATED) —
await client.cashIn({ amount, fromSource })   // SEP-24 deposit -> shield
await client.cashOut({ amount })              // unshield -> SEP-24 withdraw
```

Runnable demos drive each item against testnet:
`tests/facade/a-lifecycle.mjs` (create→shield→send→unshield + balance/history +
proving timings), `tests/facade/d-handle.mjs` (send-by-`@handle`),
`tests/facade/e-claim.mjs` (claim-links), `tests/facade/f-seed.mjs` (anonymity-set seed).

---

## Compliance model ("open by default, private when needed, compliant")

- **Privacy in the middle.** `transfer` is a 2-in/2-out join-split; amounts and
  the sender↔recipient link are hidden. No SAC movement.
- **Identity at the edges.** `shield` requires an **ASP allow-membership** proof
  (the depositor is bound in-circuit to a KYC'd allow-set leaf). `withdraw`
  requires an **ASP non-membership / proof-of-innocence** proof against the
  deny sparse-Merkle tree.
- **Guaranteed auditability.** Every note carries an MVK tag
  `Poseidon2(mvk_pub, blinding)`; a scoped **TVK** (one-way HKDF from the MVK)
  lets an auditor passively reconstruct exactly the in-scope notes from on-chain
  ciphertext — and nothing else. Viewing keys are decrypt-only; they never carry
  spend authority.
